              <br>
              <br>
              The trip will take you through a section of the <b><span>8.2-kilometer</b></span> subterranean river that runs underneath the protected cave, giving you plenty of opportunity to marvel at the <b><span>rock formations</b></span> you'll see along the way. Within the cave, you'll see <b><span>stalactites</b></span> that look like vegetables, dinosaurs, and religious images.

              <br>
              In fact, over a thousand <b><span>marine creatures</b></span>, including sea turtles, sharks, manta rays, and clownfish, may be found here. Aside from the aquatic critters, around <b><span>100 bird species</b></span> may be seen here, with some of them even building nests in the trees that cover the neighboring islands.

This <b><span>tropical getaway</b></span> allows you to unwind, relax, and get away from the everyday grind. <b><span>Kayangan Lake</b></span> is one of the main sights on Coron island-hopping trips.
              <br>
              <br>
              When you approach the <b><span>cove</b></span>, you'll have to walk a flight of stairs to a vantage point to see the most famous sight of this site. It's the most well-known attraction in the neighborhood, and it's a great site to snap photographs before heading to the lake. It's the high point of Coron's <b><span>ultimate island-hopping excursion</b></span>.

              <br>
              <br>
              They are only accessible by boat from the town main, which will take you through a maze of massive <b><span>karst walls</b></span>. You may arrange a Twin Lagoon trip if you want a hassle-free adventure.
              <br>
              <br>
              Boats dock on the <b><span>first lagoon</b></span>, and tourists must swim from there to a decrepit wooden ladder leading to the <b><span>second</b></span>. Instead, during low tide, you may wade into a tunnel that connects both lagoons.

It boasts a lengthy stretch of beautiful <b><span>white sand</b></span> and a swinging line of coconut palms beneath its stunning <b><span>limestone cliffs</b></span>. The beach is included in El Nido island hopping cruises, which also include the popular Big and Small Lagoons.
              <br>
              <br>
              The journey normally begins with a stop to <b><span>Seven Commandos</b></span>, where guests may swim, snorkel, and eat delicious coconut juice. Boats will dock for approximately <b><span>45 minutes</b></span>. After that, you may relax and rest in the region before seeing the other tourist attractions, particularly those included in the island-hopping trip in El Nido. It's the <b><span>ideal way</b></span> to spend a day in El Nido.

              <br>
              <br>
              Mt. Tapyas is an excellent <b><span>half-day excursion</b></span> for people searching for an alternative to the traditional Coron island-hopping trips.

          <b><span>Snorkeling</b></span> near the shoreline allows you to see marine life such as little fish, sea turtles, corals, and starfish. Snake Island is also a <b><span>tropical paradise</b></span> with lush vegetation and a plethora of mangroves, where monkeys are frequently spotted.

              <br>
              <br>
              During the Spanish period in the Philippines, this coastal stronghold was primarily used to <b><span>protect Taytay</b></span> against Muslim warrior-raiders. Whenever Muslim soldiers approached the little town, the Spanish army would fire guns from the stronghold.

<h2>Name Origin</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<p>It is thought that the name came from the Chinese phrase <span>Pa-Lao-Yu</span>, which means “the land of beautiful harbors." Others believe the term derives from the Indian word <span>"Palawans,"</span> which means "territory." While others believe it is derived from the Spanish word <span>"Paragua,"</span> as Palawan resembles a closed umbrella.</p>

<h2>Place History</h2>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Palawan was one of the first locations the <span>Chinese</span> arrived in the Philippines, crossing land bridges directly into the area. They first named the area. Since then, the spelling and pronunciation have changed a bit (from Pa-Lao-Yu to what is now Palawan).  Palawan became the center of <span>Chinese trade.</span> 
  <br>
  <br>
<span>Malay</span> people began coming into the area in the <span>12th century,</span> utilizing it as an agricultural foundation for developing a new settlement. They lived reasonably peacefully in the area until the early <span>17th century</span>, when the <span>Spanish</span> began to take control. They constructed missions in Palawan and began converting the locals. Although the area's diversified culture allows for the practice of many other religions, <span>Roman Catholicism</span> is the area's largest religion today.
  <br>
  <br>
  The Spanish lingered in the area until the <span>20th century</span>. There was a revolution at the time, and the <span>American</span> government assumed control of the area, forming a local administration and supporting local growth. <span>Puerto Princesa</span> was designated as the region's capital at that time. The region was destroyed during WWII and again at the turn of the twenty-first century when terrorists abducted visitors to the area. Despite this, the neighborhood is thriving, and visitors are urged to visit.
